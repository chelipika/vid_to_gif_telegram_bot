## üîß Installation (For Developers)

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.8+**
*   **FFmpeg**: This is a crucial dependency for `moviepy` to process videos. You must install it on your system.
    *   **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
    *   **macOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`
    *   **Windows**: Download the binaries from the [official FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add them to your system's PATH.
*   A **Telegram Bot Token**. Get one from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.

### Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/chelipika/vid_to_gif_telegram_bot.git
    cd vid_to_gif_telegram_bot
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure your bot:**
    Create a file named `config.py` in the root directory and add your credentials. See the [Configuration](#-configuration) section below for details.

5.  **Set up the database:**
    This project uses a database for user management. Ensure your `database/requests.py` file is correctly configured to connect to your database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).

6.  **Run the bot:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `config.py` file in the project's root directory and populate it with the following variables:

```python
# config.py

# Your Telegram bot token from @BotFather
TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"

# The ID of the channel users must subscribe to (e.g., -1001234567890)
# Make the bot an admin in this channel!
CHANNEL_ID = -1001234567890

# The public link to your channel (e.g., https://t.me/your_channel_name)
CHANNEL_LINK = "https://t.me/your_channel_name"

# (Optional) You can define FPS options here if you want to move them out of the main file
# fps_options = [5, 10, 15, 20, 30]
```
